# SplunkSight
is a hands-on SIEM project where I used Splunk to onboard authentication logs, analyze login activity using SPL, identify suspicious patterns like brute-force behavior, and build a SOC-style dashboard for visibility. The project focuses on real-world detection thinking rather than just visualizations.”
