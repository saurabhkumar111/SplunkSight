“This phase is the core of my Splunk project. I onboarded real authentication logs and treated them like a live security data source, not just a file upload. I validated timestamps and fields, then used SPL to analyze login behavior, failures, trends, and anomalies. After that, I reframed these searches into detection-style logic such as brute-force attempts, multi-user targeting, and off-hours activity. This phase shows how raw logs are converted into actionable security insights, similar to how a SOC operates in real environments.”
